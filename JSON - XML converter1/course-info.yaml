title: JSON - XML converter
language: English
summary: JSON and XML are data formats that allow us to store data in a way that is
  readable by both a computer and a human. JSON and XML are common formats of storing
  data, and since both are used, it is sometimes necessary to convert one format into
  the other. In this project, you will write a converter like that, getting useful
  experience in working with websites in the meantime. Due to the level of difficulty,
  this project will suit advanced learners who are confident enough and want to challenge
  their programming skills. Check the prerequisites, take a deep breath, and letâ€™s
  work!<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/61</a>
