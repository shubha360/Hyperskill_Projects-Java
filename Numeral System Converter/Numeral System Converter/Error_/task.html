<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's face it: errors happen. What if someone enters the wrong radix? What if the input number is impossible to convert to the given radix? What if the number is not a number at all?</p>

<p>In this final stage, we will make sure the program can handle errors like that. At this point, you can implement this without the <code class="java">try catch</code> construction. Use the following rule of thumb: if you can avoid exception-based logic, avoid it!</p>

<p>So, the goal here is to implement error messages when the input is wrong.</p>

<p>This stage is auto-graded. The grader will input some data. Then it will check that the last line of your program output contains the word "error" if the input is wrong.</p>

<p>If the input is correct, your program should behave as in the previous stage.</p>
