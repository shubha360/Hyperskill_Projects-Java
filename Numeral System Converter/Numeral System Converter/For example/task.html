<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>In this project, you will be creating your own numeral system converter. If you don't know what a numeral system is, or simply need to brush up on the topic, browse through the relevant <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system">Wikipedia</a> page.</p>

<p>Implement a program that outputs a number in two systems: the first is decimal, and the second one is binary. This must be <strong>the same </strong>number represented in different systems; feel free to choose any number you like.</p>

<p>This stage is auto-graded. The grader will check that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you output a single line;</li>
	<li>there are two numbers;</li>
	<li>the first number is decimal;</li>
	<li>the second number is binary (it starts with <code class="java">0b</code> and contains only <code class="java">0</code> and <code class="java">1</code>);</li>
	<li>the first number is equal to the second one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you do not need to enter anything into the program, you should print a line prepared in advance.<strong> </strong>A single String is expected to be printed.</p>
