<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should find the inverse of a matrix.</p>

<p>The inverse matrix <span class="math-tex">\( A^{−1} \)</span> is the matrix whose<span style="color: #ff4363;"> </span>product with the original matrix<span style="color: #ff4363;"> </span><span class="math-tex">\(A\)</span> is equal to the identity matrix.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( A \times A^{-1} = A^{-1} \times A = I \)</span></p>

<p>Watch a video about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMLUikdDQGk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the inverse of a matrix</a> to get the basic idea. To get a deeper understanding, check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&amp;index=7" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> 3Blue1Brown channel</a>.</p>

<p>The identity matrix is a matrix where all elements of the main diagonal are ones, and other elements are zeros. Here is an example of a <span class="math-tex">\(4, 4\)</span> identity matrix:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(I_{4,4} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1&amp;0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;1\end{pmatrix}\)</span></p>

<p>The inverse of a matrix can be found using this formula:<br>
       <br>
<span class="math-tex">\( A^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{det(A)} \times C^T \)</span></p>

<p>As you can see, it contains a lot of operations you implemented in the previous stages: finding cofactors of all the elements of the matrix, transposition of the matrix, finding the determinant of a matrix, and multiplication of a matrix by a constant.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( det(A) \)</span> is the determinant of matrix <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span>, and <span class="math-tex">\( C^T \)</span> is the matrix consisting of cofactors of all elements of the matrix <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span> transposed along the main diagonal. The inverse matrix can’t be found if <span class="math-tex">\( det(A) \)</span> equals zero. You can look up a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfhzwNkMNg4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">calculation example</a>.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, your program should support finding the inverse of a matrix. Refer to the example to see how it should be implemented.</p>

<p>Note that in some cases the inverse of a matrix does not exist. In such cases, your program should output a warning message.</p>

<h2>Additional improvements</h2>

<p>Although it's not required in this stage and we won't check, you can implement a method that prints a matrix in a readable way so that every column is correctly aligned and all elements are rounded to a fixed number of digits.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
