<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should write a program that calculates a <strong>determinant </strong>of a matrix. You can check out some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">videos about linear algebra</a> to understand the essence of the determinant and why it is important. To see how to calculate the determinant of any square matrix, watch a video about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMKd993vG9Q" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">minors and cofactors</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9BWRYJNIv4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">computing the nxn determinant</a>. Also, here's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-determinant.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">nice graphic explanation</a> on minors and cofactors. </p>

<p>A <strong>determinant</strong> is a single number that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. There is a classical way to find the determinant of a matrix with an order <span class="math-tex">\(&lt;3\)</span>.</p>

<p>A determinant of a 2-order matrix is equal to the difference between the product of elements on the main diagonal and the product of elements on the side diagonal:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(\det\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{pmatrix} = a_{11}\times a_{22} - a_{12}\times a_{21}\)</span></p>

<p>Now let's move on to the minor and the cofactor of a matrix.<br>
<br>
<span class="math-tex">\( Minor_{(i, j)} \)</span> of a matrix is the determinant of the submatrix we get from the remaining elements after removing the <em>i</em> row and <em>j</em> column from this matrix.</p>

<p>Below is an example of <span class="math-tex">\( Minor_{(2, 2)} \)</span> for matrix <span class="math-tex">\( A_{3 \times 3} \)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(M_{2,2}\begin{pmatrix} a_{1,1} &amp; {\color{red}a_{1,2}}&amp;a_{1,3} \\ {\color{red}a_{2,1}} &amp; {\color{red}a_{2,2}} &amp;{\color{red}a_{2,3}} \\ a_{3,1} &amp; {\color{red}a_{3,2}} &amp; a_{3,3} \end{pmatrix} =\det\begin{pmatrix} a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,3} \\ a_{3,1} &amp; a_{3,3} \end{pmatrix}\)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\( Cofactor_{(i, j)} \)</span> of a matrix is the corresponding <span class="math-tex">\( Minor_{(i, j)} \)</span> multiplied by <span class="math-tex">\( (-1)^{i+j} \)</span>. Notice that the cofactor is always preceded by a positive <span class="math-tex">\(+\)</span> or negative <span class="math-tex">\(-\)</span> sign.</p>

<p>We often need to find the determinant of a matrix of the order greater than <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span>. In this case, we have to use expansion by rows or columns where the determinant is equal to a sum of a single row or a single column multiplied by the cofactors of the elements in the corresponding row or column. To do this, you should use a recursive method.</p>

<p>Below is an example of computing the determinant of a matrix of order <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> by first-row expansion, where <span class="math-tex">\(c\)</span> stands for the <span class="math-tex">\( Cofactor \)</span> :</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(\det\begin{pmatrix} a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; a_{1,3} &amp; a_{1,4} \\ a_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; a_{2,3} &amp; a_{2,4} \\ a_{3,1} &amp; a_{3,2} &amp; a_{3,3} &amp; a_{3,4} \\ a_{4,1} &amp; a_{4,2} &amp; a_{4,3} &amp; a_{4,4} \end{pmatrix} = M_{1,1}\times c_{1,1} + M_{1,2}\times c_{1,2}+M_{1,3}\times c_{1,3} +M_{1,4}\times c_{1,4}\)</span></p>
