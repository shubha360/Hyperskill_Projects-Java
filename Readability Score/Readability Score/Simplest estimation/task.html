<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Ever wondered how to assess if the text is hard or easy to read? For a human, this task is pretty simple: you just read the text and feel if you're struggling or not. But how to teach a computer do that? In this project, you will write such a program.</p>

<p>Firstly, let's create a simple program. If a text contains more than 100 symbols (including spaces and punctuation), then it is considered hard to read. Otherwise, the text is considered easy to read. If a text contains exactly 100 symbols, it is still easy to read.</p>

<p>The input contains a single line of text. Output "HARD" if the text is hard to read and "EASY" if the text is easy to read.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is easy to read!
EASY</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is hard to read. It contains a lot of sentences as well as a lot of words in each sentence.
HARD</code></pre>
