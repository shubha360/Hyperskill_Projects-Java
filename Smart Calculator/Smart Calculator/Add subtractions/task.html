<h2>Description</h2>

<p>At this stage, your calculator should support the addition <code class="java">+</code> and subtraction <code class="java">-</code> operators.</p>

<p>The program must calculate expressions like these: <code class="java">4 + 6 - 8</code>, <code class="java">2 - 3 - 4</code>, and so on. It must support both unary and binary minus operators. If the user has entered several same operators following each other, the program still should work (like Java or Python REPL).</p>

<p>Consider that the even number of minuses gives a plus, and the odd number of minuses gives a minus! Look at it this way: <code class="java">2 -- 2</code> equals <code class="java">2 - (-2)</code> equals <code class="java">2 + 2</code>.</p>

<p>Modify the result of the <code class="java">/help</code> command to explain these operations.</p>

<p>Decompose your program using methods to make it easy to understand and edit later.</p>

<h2>Input/Output example</h2>

<pre><code class="java">8
8

-2 + 4 - 5 + 6
3
9 +++ 10 -- 8
27
3 --- 5
-2
14  -   12
2
/exit
Bye!</code></pre>

<p> </p>

<p>The program should not stop until the user enters the <code class="java">/exit</code> command.</p>
