<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A number is a <strong>Jumping number </strong>if the adjacent digits inside the number differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is not considered as 1. Single-digit numbers are considered Jumping numbers. For example, 78987, and 4343456 are Jumping numbers, but 796 and 89098 are not.</p>

<p>In this stage, we will also remove the limitation on pending properties in a request. The program knows how to calculate ten properties of numbers, and it would be strange to limit the query to just two properties. Let's remove this limitation. Let the program indicate all properties for all numbers in the request.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Welcome users;</li>
	<li>Display the instructions;</li>
	<li>Ask for a request;</li>
	<li>If a user enters zero, terminate the program; </li>
	<li>If numbers are not natural, print the error message;</li>
	<li>If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;</li>
	<li>For one number, print the properties of the number;</li>
	<li>For two numbers, print the list of numbers with their properties.</li>
	<li>For two numbers and properties, print the numbers with the specified properties;</li>
	<li>If a user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn the user;</li>
	<li>Once a request has been processed, continue execution from step 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the current stage, the property names include <code class="java">even</code>, <code class="java">odd</code>, <code class="java">buzz</code>, <code class="java">duck</code>, <code class="java">palindromic</code>, <code class="java">gapful</code>, <code class="java">spy</code>, <code class="java">square</code>, <code class="java">sunny</code>, and <code class="java">jumping</code>. The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like.</p>

<h3> Instructions</h3>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Supported requests:
- enter a natural number to know its properties;
- enter two natural numbers to obtain the properties of the list:

- two natural numbers and properties to search for;
- separate the parameters with one space;
- enter 0 to exit.</code></pre>

<h3>Error messages</h3>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.</code></pre>
