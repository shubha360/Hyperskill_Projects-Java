<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, we will add another property that is called a <strong>Spy number</strong>. A number is said to be Spy if the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits.</p>

<p>Our program calculates the properties of numbers, and also knows how to process a list of numbers. But what if we want to find numbers that have a certain property? For example, in case we want to find ten Buzz numbers starting from 1000. We need to add a new request feature for this. In addition, add a new property â€” Spy numbers. These numbers hide well, so beware. Your task is to modify the program so that it can search for these numbers.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Welcome users;</li>
    <li>Display the instructions;</li>
    <li>Ask for a request;</li>
    <li>If a user enters zero, terminate the program;</li>
    <li>If numbers are not natural, print an error message;</li>
    <li>If a user inputs an incorrect property, print the error message and the list of available properties;</li>
    <li>For one number, print the properties of the number;</li>
    <li>For two numbers, print the list of numbers with their properties;</li>
    <li>For two numbers and a property, print the list of numbers and their properties filtered by the indicated property;</li>
    <li>Once a request is processed, continue execution from step 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the current stage, the property names include <code class="java">even</code>, <code class="java">odd</code>, <code class="java">buzz</code>, <code class="java">duck</code>, <code class="java">palindromic</code> , <code class="java">gapful</code>, and <code class="java">spy</code>. The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like. Please, add the information below:</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

- two natural numbers and a property to search for;
- separate the parameters with one space;
- enter 0 to exit.</code></pre>
