<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Code from the previous stage works but is ineffective because every byte contains only 3 significant bits. All the rest is just an overhead to reliably send the message.</p>

<p>In this stage, we will use a more efficient code, the <strong>Hamming code</strong>. In this code, every byte contains 4 significant bits, and the other 4 bits are used as an overhead (well, only 3 of them are used as an overhead, the last one just isn't used).</p>

<p>To better understand how this code works, watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=373FUw-2U2k" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> video.</p>

<p>We will use the Hamming code [7,4], i.e. will write 7 bits, 4 of them would be significant bits, 3 of them would be parity bits and the last one would be unused (it should always be set to zero). Note that the video showed the Hamming code [12, 8] with 12 bits which contain 8 significant bits. You should use a smaller version of the Hamming code (just throw away from 9th to 12th bit from the video).</p>

<p>What should you do if the error occurs twice within a single byte? In our program, it won't happen since you simulate a single error in each byte. However, in real life, it definitely can happen. In telecommunications, all messages are split into packages. If errors in the package can't be corrected then this package should be retransmitted.</p>
