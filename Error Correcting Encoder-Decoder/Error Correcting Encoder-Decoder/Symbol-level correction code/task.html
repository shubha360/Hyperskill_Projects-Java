<p>Errors are made, but how to correct them?</p>

<p>Since we know that the error can be at max every 3 symbols, we can record every symbol 3 times. So, every symbol would be tripled before sending to the internet via a poor connection. Since we have only one error for 3 symbols, in every 3 symbols 2 will necessarily be the same.</p>

<p>For example, if the user wants to send this text: <code class="java">"Ab"</code>, coded text before sending would be: <code class="java">"AAAbbb"</code>, the text after receiving through poor internet connection would be something like <code class="java">"AsAbb2"</code> (as in the previous stage), after decoding we can get <code class="java">"Ab"</code> since the first three symbols contain two A's and the second three symbols contain two b's.</p>

<p>In this stage, you should write a program that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Takes a message the user wants it to send. The input contains a single message.</li>
	<li>Encode the message by tripling all the symbols.</li>
	<li>Simulate sending this message via a poor internet connection (in other words, simulate errors).</li>
	<li>Decode it back again.</li>
</ol>

<p>Output the message on every step!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not part of the input.</p>
