<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The theatre is getting popular, and the customers started complaining that it's not practical that the program stops after buying one ticket. Let's add a menu that will allow them to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement when needed.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>At the start, your program should read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row. Then, it should print a menu with the following three items:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code class="java">Show the seats</code> should print the current seating arrangement. The empty seats should be marked with an <code class="java">S</code> symbol, and taken seats are marked with a <code class="java">B</code> symbol.</li>
	<li><code class="java">Buy a ticket</code> should read the seat coordinates from the input and print the ticket price like in the previous stage. After that, the chosen seat should be marked with a <code class="java">B</code> when the item <code class="java">Show the seats</code> is called.</li>
	<li><code class="java">Exit</code> should stop the program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
