<h2> Description</h2>

<p>It's very upsetting when the data about registered users disappears after the program is completed. To avoid this problem, you need to create a database where you will store all the necessary information about the created credit cards. We will use SQLite to create the database.</p>

<p>SQLite is a database engine. It is software that allows users to interact with a relational database. In SQLite, a database is stored in a single file — a trait that distinguishes it from other database engines. This allows for greater accessibility: copying a database is no more complicated than copying the file that stores the data, and sharing a database implies just sending an email attachment.</p>

<p>You may consult the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-java/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SQL tutorial website</a> to navigate the work with SQLite from Java.</p>

<p>You don’t have to install any libraries to work with a database — you can use it in the project without any problems.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, create a database with a table titled <code class="java">card</code>. It should have the following columns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>id INTEGER</li>
	<li>number TEXT</li>
	<li>pin TEXT</li>
	<li>balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, in this stage, you should read the database file name from the command line argument. Filename should be passed to the program using <code class="java">-fileName</code> argument, for example, <code class="java">-fileName db.s3db</code>.</p>

<p>Pay attention: your database file should be created when the program starts, if it hasn’t yet been created. And all created cards should be stored in the database from now.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Notice that it's not a part of the input.</p>
