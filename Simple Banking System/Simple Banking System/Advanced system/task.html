<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You have created the foundation of our banking system. Now let's take the opportunity to deposit money into an account, make transfers and close an account if necessary.</p>

<p>Now your menu should look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1. Balance
2. Add income
3. Do transfer
4. Close account
5. Log out
0. Exit</code></pre>

<p>If the user asks for <code class="java">Balance</code>, you should read the balance of the account from the database and output it into the console.</p>

<p><code class="java">Add income</code> item should allow us to deposit money to the account.</p>

<p><code class="java">Do transfer</code> item should allow transferring money to another account. You should handle the following errors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the user tries to transfer more money than he/she has, output: <code class="java">Not enough money!</code></li>
	<li>If the user tries to transfer money to the same account, output the following message: <code class="java">You can't transfer money to the same account!</code></li>
	<li>If the receiver's card number doesn’t pass the Luhn algorithm, you should output: <code class="java">Probably you made a mistake in the card number. Please try again!</code></li>
	<li>If the receiver's card number doesn’t exist, you should output: <code class="java">Such a card does not exist.</code></li>
	<li>If there is no error, ask the user how much money they want to transfer and make the transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the user chooses the <code class="java">Close an account</code> item, you should delete that account from the database.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Notice that it's not a part of the input.</p>
