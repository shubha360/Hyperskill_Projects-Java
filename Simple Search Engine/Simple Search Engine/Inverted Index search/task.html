<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Now your program can successfully search for all matching lines, ignoring cases and extra spaces. There is one problem though: you need to check whether each line contains a query string or not.</p>

<p>To optimize your program, you can use a data structure called <strong>Inverted Index</strong>. It maps each word to all positions/lines/documents in which the word occurs. As a result, when we receive a query, we can immediately find the answer without any comparisons.</p>

<p>At this stage, build an inverted index when the program starts, and then use the index for searching operations. You can implement it using a <code class="java">Map</code> class. It connects an item with a list (or set) of indexes belonging to the lines that contain the item.</p>

<p>Suppose you have the following array or list of lines:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">0: Katie Jacobs
1: Erick Harrington harrington@gmail.com
2: Myrtle Medina
3: Erick Burgess</code></pre>

<p>For these lines, the inverted index will look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Katie -&gt; [0]
Jacobs -&gt; [0]
Erick -&gt; [1, 3]
Harrington -&gt; [1]
harrington@gmail.com -&gt; [1]
Myrtle -&gt; [2]
Medina -&gt; [2]
Burgess -&gt; [3]</code></pre>

<p>The order of pairs is not important. If you are searching for Erick, you can immediately get the target fields using this mapping.</p>

<p>Note that the Inverted Index is<strong> </strong>not intended to search for parts of a word, it is only used to search for full words.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The lines that start with <code class="java">&gt; </code> represent the user input. Note that these symbols are not part of the input. </p>
