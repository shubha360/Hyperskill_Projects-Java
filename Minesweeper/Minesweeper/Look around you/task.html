<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>The player needs hints to be able to win, and we want them to have a chance to win! Let's show the number of mines around the empty cells so that our players have something to work with.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>As in the previous step, you need to initialize the field with mines. Then, calculate how many mines there are around each empty cell. Check 8 cells if the current cell is in the middle of the field, 5 cells if it's on the side, and 3 cells if it's in the corner.</p>

<p>If there are mines around the cell, display the number of mines (from 1 to 8) instead of the symbol representing an empty cell. The symbols for empty cells and mines stay the same.</p>

<p>Check all the possibilities carefully. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
