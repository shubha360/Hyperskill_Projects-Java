summary: When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary,
  which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a
  task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can
  be used to remember any sort of data, so if you want to create a useful tool to
  help your learning and your programming skills, this project is for you.<br/><br/>Learn
