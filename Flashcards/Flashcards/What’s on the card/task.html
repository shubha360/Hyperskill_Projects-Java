<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Of course, we cannot use flashcards with only one hardcoded card. So let's make our program more dynamic! Let’s create flashcards depending on the user's input and add a primitive guessing mechanism so that the user can check how well they remember the definitions.</p>

<p>In this stage, you need to implement a custom flashcard-creation mechanism which will be extensively used in further steps, and add a mechanism to check the user's answer.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Your program should read two lines from the console, a <em>term,</em> and a <em>definition, </em>that represent a card. </p>

<p>After that, the user inputs a line as an <em>answer</em> (a definition of the term on the card). Compare the user's answer with the correct definition and print the result. </p>

<p>The output of the program must contain one of two words:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code class="java">wrong</code> if the answer doesn't match the definition;</li>
	<li><code class="java">right</code> if the answer matches the definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, at this point, the user is unlikely to get the answer wrong, since they’re the ones who just typed in the answer... But don’t worry: right now we're just warming up so that in later stages we could make this a bit more challenging for our users.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>the user's answer is correct</em></p>

<p>Input (a term, then a definition, and, finally, an answer):</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; print()
&gt; outputs text
&gt; outputs text
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Your answer is right!
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2: </strong><em>the user's answer is incorrect</em></p>

<p>Input (a term, a definition, an answer):</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; Jetbrains
&gt; A place for people who love to code
&gt; A place for people who hate to code
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Your answer is wrong...</code></pre>
