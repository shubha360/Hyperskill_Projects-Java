<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Now it's time to make a working game, so let's create our first opponent! In this version of the program, the user will be playing as <code class="java">X</code>, and the computer will be playing as <code class="java">O</code> at <code class="java">easy</code> level. This will be our first small step towards creating the AI!</p>

<p>Let's design it so that at this level the computer makes random moves. This should be perfect for people who have never played the game before!</p>

<p>If you want, you could make the game even simpler by including a difficulty level where the computer never wins. Feel free to create this along with the <code class="java">easy</code> level if you like, but it won't be tested.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should implement the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Display an empty table when the program starts.</li>
    <li>The user plays first as <code class="java">X</code>, and the program should ask the user to enter cell coordinates.</li>
    <li>Next, the computer makes its move as <code class="java">O</code>, and the players then move in turn until someone wins or the game results in a draw.</li>
    <li>Print the final outcome at the very end of the game.</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">The project was changed. Now the coordinates start from the upper left corner. Look closely at the examples.</div></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The example below shows how your program should work.<br>
    The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
