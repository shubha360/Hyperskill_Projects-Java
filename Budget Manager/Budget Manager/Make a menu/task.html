<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's make your application more convenient. Only counting the expenses is a little bit sad, right?</p>

<p>To make your application flexible and functional, add a menu that consists of 4 items.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Add Income</strong>. We must track both our expenses and our income. When this item is selected, the program should ask to enter the amount of income.</li>
	<li><strong>Add Purchase</strong>. This item should add a purchase to the list. You have implemented this feature in the previous stage.</li>
	<li><strong>Show the list of purchases</strong>. This menu item should display a list of all expenses and incomes in the order they were made.</li>
	<li><strong>Balance</strong>. Show the balance.</li>
	<li><strong>Exit</strong>. Exit the program. Make this item under number <strong>0</strong>, not number 5.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice, that the amount of remaining money cannot be negative. In this case, make the balance equal to $0.</p>

<p>When displaying the price or the total amount, print 2 numbers after the point.<br>
Example: <code class="java">$14.20</code><br>
Follow this rule in the next stages.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not part of the input.</p>
