<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>To better control the expenses, we need to categorize our purchases. It helps to see how exactly your budget is distributed: you may be actually quite surprised! </p>

<p>Implement a function that assigns a purchase to a specific category.</p>

<p>The program should have the following categories:<br>
<strong>Food<br>
Clothes<br>
Entertainment<br>
Other</strong></p>

<p>The function allows you to output the shopping list by type. After selecting the action of showing the list of expenses, offer to show either a certain category or a general list. At the end print the total amount of purchases that are on the list.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not part of the input.</p>
