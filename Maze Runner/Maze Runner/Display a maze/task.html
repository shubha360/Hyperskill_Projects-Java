<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Implement the maze as a two-dimensional array of integers. If the value of an element is 1, it is a wall. If the value is 0, it is a passage.</p>

<p>Your maze must be 10x10. Other rules are as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>There should be walls around the maze, except for two cells: entrance and exit.</li>
	<li>Any empty cell should be accessible from the entrance or exit of the maze. It is impossible to move diagonally, only vertically or horizontally.</li>
	<li>There has to be a path from the entrance to the exit. It doesn't matter what is considered an entrance and what is an exit as they are interchangeable.</li>
</ol>

<p>To print the array, follow these two rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>to display a pass, use two space characters;</li>
	<li>to display a wall, use two block characters in a row (the same): █ (U+2588).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can print a wall like this: <code class="java">System.out.print("\u2588\u2588")</code>.</p>

<p>Remember that the maze is only visible if you have a monospaced font! Otherwise, the space symbol will be quite small in width.</p>

<p>At this stage, it does not matter what maze you display. The program may always output the same prepared maze or one of a set of prepared mazes.</p>

<p>After starting, your program should output a maze and then stop.</p>
